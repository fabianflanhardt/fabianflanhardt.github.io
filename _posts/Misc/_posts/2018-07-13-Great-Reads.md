It's summer vacation time and this year we're spending our days visiting my girlfriend's parents at the Bulgarian seaside. Looking forward to plenty of time to spend in their beautiful garden, well protected from the burning sun by a roof covered with grapes, I extended my library with some new books. I have to admit, when extending my knowledge in a specific area, I don't really like doing so by reading a full blown book on that topic, but prefer wiki like collections of short articles where you can quickly jump around and just focus on the stuff you need right in that moment. However, there are definitely some classic style books, that I dont want to miss. In this post. I want to share some of those with you.

## A History of the World in 100 Objects - Neil McGregor
A History of the World in 100 Objects is a collection of short stories, each related to an object from the collection of the british museum. Neil MacGregor, director of the museum at the time he wrote the book, understands perfectly to wrap an exciting story around each object, that made me want more. Originally, the book was a cooperation with a radio station and thus is great for listening as an audio book. 

## The Marshmallow Test - Walter Mischel
In "The Marshmallow Test", Walter Mischel, a Stanford psycholigist, writes about his studies about human behaviour and how it relates to success. Starting with the test itself, the book goes far beyond and dives into how our brain works and provides some great strategies on what we can do to improve long term success in the things we want to achieve.

## Drive - Daniel H. Pink
"Drive - The suprising truth what motivates us" is all about the different factors of human motivation and how they work on short as well as long term. The book perfectly combines what today's science knows about that and how it can be utilized in the business world to improve both, employee satisfaction and long term success.
